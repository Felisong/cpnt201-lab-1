# _Why do we love cats?_

This is evil

## they are VERY cute. and evil.

There was one time where my friend's cat slapped the bubble tea off of the table into her laptop. There was another time when I saw my cat fall off the Christmas tree, because he was fat.
There was another time where a cat decided that it was sick, and thought that it could walk through a glass door like it didn't exist. Shock it hit it's head and started crying for hours. MY CAT IS CUTE, she goes meow meow and cuddles with me

Reasons why Cats are adorable and are not evil:

1. They are a great friend when you need one
2. They do come to cuddle and care when you cry (sometimes)
