# Why do we love cats?

This is evil

## **they are VERY cute. and evil.**

There was one time where my friend's cat slapped the bubble tea off of the table into her laptop. There was another time when I saw my cat fall off the Christmas tree, because he was fat.
There was another time where a cat decided that it was sick, and thought that it could walk through a glass door like it didn't exist. Shock it hit it's head and started crying for hours. MY CAT IS CUTE, she goes meow meow and cuddles with me though.
